This repo contains the jupyter notebook to predict the demand of shared bikes

## Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider __BoomBikes__ has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

For this, they want to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands

## We would be following the below steps in order to build our model
* EDA
    * Understanding the data
    * Data Cleaning
    * Visualizing the data
* Data Preparation
    * Create Dummy variables
* Splitting the data in test/train
* Rescaling the features
* Build Model
* Residual analysis on train data
* Make Prediction on Test data
* Check Hypothesis
* Evaluate Model
